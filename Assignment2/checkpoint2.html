       <h1>Software Engeineer</h1>
       <P>My Name is Jonatan Johnny Rassekhnia, my goals have been going on since 2014. Three years after i moved back to my birth country 
          Sweden. My first three years i was just fooling around going out and party with my friends. But i came to a point for one of the 
          reasons that i have moved was to change my life around. It started from 2014. I knew i needed a job to make this change. I got hired
          in a company that leases Industrial Machines to construction workers. My goal has always been achieving my Computer Science Degree
        </P>

            “Automation does increase productivity, as it has done throughout history. That part hasn’t changed and isn’t new,” says Ritter. “What is new, however, is the nature of the jobs we’re able to displace. As AI becomes more capable, takes on more cognitive tasks, and replaces more skilled jobs, the rate of change will become the biggest challenge.” 
            “My concern isn’t that jobs will go away, it’s that the type of jobs needs to change and we – governments and society – need to do more to prepare our workforce for that change. At the end of the day I think AI will create a stronger economy and more interesting work, but if we aren’t ready for the change, we simply won’t be able to adapt”

        <h4>AI in the future</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline workflows and processes accelerated the exit of many workers across multiple industries, from manufacturing to customer service and more. ... According to a report from the World Economic Forum, 85 million jobs will be replaced by machines with AI by the year 2025.

            Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention
            Because of new computing technologies, machine learning today is not like machine learning of the past. It was born from pattern recognition and the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks; researchers interested in artificial intelligence wanted to see if computers could learn from data. The iterative aspect of machine learning is important because as models are exposed to new data, they are able to independently adapt. They learn from previous computations to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results. It’s a science that’s not new – but one that has gained fresh momentum.

            Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.

            Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.
            
            Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and software. The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract-- determining what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures.
            
            Graduates of University of Maryland’s Computer Science Department are lifetime learners; they are able to adapt quickly with this challenging field.

<!--Task-->
<!--
it shall use utf-8 as character encoding /Done
you must ensure that å, ä and ö are displayed correctly /Done
the body text should be "helvetica", secondary arial and finally "sans-serif". 14px large or equivalent with any device. Dark gray (# 222). Build a so-called font stack in css and think about whether that last, "sans-serif" is really needed? /Done
the body text should have a "line spacing" of 1.5x the size of the font./Done
heading 1 - "Roboto Condensed" 700 from Google Fonts (linked directly to their service), secondary font "Arial", and finally "sans-serif". Bold. 26px large. Blue (# 009).
I want the letters in a heading 1 to be a little longer apart than "normal". /Done
also, a little tricky, put a thin light gray frame around each letter in the title using css. It will thus be like a contour around each of the letters.
also add a slight shading on heading 1 /Done
heading 2 - "Museo Sans" in weight 500 from FontSquirrel (linked via @ font-face as you write in your style), "Arial", and finally "sans-serif". 18px large. Blue (# 009). /Done
The fonts should be in a format that works in the majority of browsers (ie create an @ font-face that covers as many browsers as possible. Is a file format on the font enough then?)/Done
heading 3 and below - "Aller" from FontSquirrel. Or? Can we use it? Should we use it? Read the license text carefully. Otherwise, choose another font that you can use from FontSquirrel. 14px, blue, bold. Then select the rest of the fonts in a separate font stack. /Done
the headings must have margins or padding that allows them to distance themselves from the rest of the text. 
create an appearance for the tag called "em" in your css. I want bold style on this tag. Then wrap any piece of text with the em tag./ Done
all links must be light blue and not underlined. However, they should be underlined + darker color when you move the mouse pointer over them. /Done
paragraphs without a heading in between shall be 16px apart /Done
the first line of paragraphs shall be indented (inserted) 26px./Done
the bulleted list must have a square "dot" for each list item if you use an unnumbered list. If you use an ordered list, it must be arranged with Roman numerals /Done
Addresses for images and links that are internally on the website must be relative addresses. /Done
the files must be validated on W3C's HTML Validator and W3C's CSS Validator (Links to an external site.). -End Process
