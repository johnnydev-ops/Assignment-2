Specifications
- use utf-8 as character encoding
- you must ensure that å, ä and ö are displayed correctly "Swedish Characteriztion"
- the body text should be "helvetica", secondary arial and finally "sans-serif". 14px large or equivalent with any device. Dark gray (# 222). Build a so-called font stack in css     and think about whether that last, "sans-serif" is really needed?
- the body text must have a "line spacing" of 1.5x the size of the font.
- heading 1 - "Roboto Condensed" 700 from Google Fonts (linked directly to their service), secondary font "Arial", and lastly "sans-serif". Bold. 26px large. Blue (# 009).
- I want the letters in a heading 1 to be a little longer apart than "normal".
- Put a thin light gray frame around each letter in the title using css. It will thus be like a contour around each of the letters.
- add a slight shading on heading 1
- heading 2 - "Museo Sans" in weight 500 from FontSquirrel (linked via @ font-face as you write in your style), "Arial", and finally "sans-serif". 18px large. Blue (# 009). 
- The fonts should be in a format that works in the majority of browsers (ie create an @ font-face that covers as many browsers as possible. Is a file format on the font enough     then?)
- heading 3 and below - "Aller" from FontSquirrel. Or? Can we use it? Should we use it? Read the license text carefully. Otherwise, choose another font that you can use from         FontSquirrel. 14px, blue, bold. Then select the rest of the fonts in a separate font stack.
- the headings must have margins or padding that allows them to distance themselves from the rest of the text.
- create an appearance for the tag called "em" in your css. I want bold style on this tag. Then wrap any piece of text with the em tag.
- all links must be light blue and not underlined. However, they should be underlined + darker color when you hover the mouse pointer over them.
- paragraphs without a heading in between shall be 16px apart
- the first line of paragraphs shall be indented (inserted) 26px.
- the bulleted list must have a square "dot" for each list item if you use an unnumbered list. If you use an ordered list, it must be arranged with Roman numerals
- Addresses for images and links that are internally on the website must be relative addresses.
- the files must be validated on W3C's HTML Validator and W3C's CSS Validator (Links to an external site.).
